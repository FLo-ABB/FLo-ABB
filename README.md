## About Me üßê

I'm an ABB robot expert with a passion for exploring new technologies. I believe that mastering technology is the key to staying ahead of the curve. My Motto:

    I am Optimus Prime, and I send this message to any surviving Autobots taking refuge among the stars: 
    We are here. We are waiting.

I enjoy pushing boundaries and learning new skills through development. It lets me create tools to help me do monkey work, and I'm happy to share them with you.
